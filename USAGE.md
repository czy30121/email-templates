## Usage
Clone this repository or download as a zip to get started. Email templates already contain some style, but are intended to be used as a starting point for you to customize to match your brand.

To get started, open a template in your favorite code editor. By default, the Paste templates contain some placeholder content that we suggest replacing with your own information. The templates contain HTML comments describing the sections and in certain cases the content within those sections will explain their purpose (e.g. preheader). 

* Update the `title` within the `head` of your template so it's easy to understand the purpose
* Make any branding changes to the `style` block within the `head` to update webfonts or other base styles
* Replace the preheader text with content that summarizes your email
* Update the logo by adjusting the `src=""` attribute to point to a URL that hosts your logo
* Update the permission text to explain why the recipient is receiving the email
* Update the unsubscribe link and ensure your address is correct
* Update any specific content within the email (this will differ based on the template)
* Make any branding chages to the inline styles, look for `bg-color` and `style` tags on elements
